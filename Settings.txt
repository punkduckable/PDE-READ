# This file controls the program settings. The file consists of blank, comment,
# and setting lines. Each comment line begins with '#'. Each setting line uses
# the following format:
#         <Setting Name> [<data type>] : <value>
# <value>'s data type must match <data type>. You can place any number of spaces
# between the colon and <value> (the spacing after the colon doesn't matter, so
# long as the setting is all on one line). Nothing can appear after <value> on a
# setting line. You CAN NOT change the order of the setting lines.
#
# The reader will ignore all blank and comment lines. Thus, you can add them as
# you see fit, as they will not break the reader.

# Save, Load Settings
# The "Floating Point Precision" setting does not need to match that of the
# saved state. Thus, for example, you can load a save that used singles into a
# network that uses doubles.
#
# The Load/Save File Name, and the Data File Name can not contain spaces. The
# Data File Name should include a file extension.
#
# The code will NOT load the Optimizer if in Extraction mode. In this case, the
# Reader ignores the load optimizer setting.

# Mode
# The "Discovery, or Extraction mode" setting controls what the code
# does. The allowed values for this setting are "Discovery" or
# "Extraction". Actually, the reader will interpret any word that begins with
# "d" or "D" as "Discovery" and any word that begins with "e" or "E" as
# "Extraction".
#
# In Discovery mode, the code trains both the Solution and PDE networks. The
# loss consists of data and collocation losses. In this mode, the reader will
# ignore the Extraction settings (so you can too!)
#
# In Extraction mode, the code trains neither network. Instead, it attempts to
# extract a PDE from the PDE network (which means you should load a trained
# PDE network). In this mode, you must set the "Extracted PDE term degree" and
# "Number of Extraction Points" settings. The former controls the maximum degree
# of the terms that we try to extract (the term du_dx has degree one, u*du_dx
# has degree 2, u^2 (du_dx)^3 d^2u_dx^2 has order 6, etc.). The latter controls
# the number of points (in the PDE domain) at which we attempt to fit the PDE.

# PDE settings.
# These settings control the nature of the PDE we try to uncover. Our goal is
# to find a PDE of the following form:
#         D_t^m U = N(U, D_x U, D_x^2 U, ... , D_x^n U)
# Here, m = Time Derivative Order, and n = Spatial Derivative Order.

# If you Load the Optimizer state, the Optimizer type must match that of the

# Architecture settings below must match those of the saved network. (same
